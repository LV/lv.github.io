27

- this is an arbitrary age I've been thinking about for a very long time
  - probably stems from the fact that it was my dad's age when he had me
  - been thinking about it quite hard since I was 19; the two big ones was 21 and 27
    - maybe it's also an aesthetics thing?
  - In many ways, it's an age that I stupidly assigned myself as "The age where I really begin to live my life"
    - realize it's so incredibly dumb in a lot of ways
  - I had certain goals way back in covid, mainly physical body goals
    - certainly did not succeed in this regard, in many ways I've been a failure in regards to the objectives I set myself out for 6 years ago
    - but I'm living in NYC, make good money, have a good gig, and am still the same good person I believe I am
      - I would consider myself extremely successful today, irrespective of my failures to meet my objectives and goals set out years ago
        - But the goals and the things I thought as important, shifted throughout time as it should've
          - Lesson here is that I won't make the same mistakes in setting out goals for things so far into the future, because the things I find important today may (likely) not be important in the future

The main takeaway is to continue heading in a good general direction and see what unfolds

BUT DON'T COMPROMISE ON YOURSELF

Promises to myself for this year:
  - I will publish more, and follow through on my creative cravings
    - Whether that would be PRs for my personal projects, YouTube videos, or blog posts

Promises to myself for the rest of my life:
  - The moment where I will "begin to really live life" will always be the present, and never delegated to the future

Things that I radically need to improve in my life:
  - Sleep earlier, and better
  - Wake up earlier

Things I'm grateful for:
  - Family, genuinely. I am the luckiest person in the world in this regard, in the context of both immediate and extended family
  - Friends. I don't know what I've done to deserve such good people throughout my life
  - Luck. I realize how lucky I've been in the hand I've been dealt with in life. Not only do I have great friends and family (my support system), I also grew up in all corners of the world, graduated debt free, somehow got a good gig in NYC, and am living a dream I couldn't have imagined a mere 6 years ago.
    - The only thing is that I need to realize that I'm living this dream instead of losing this focus and being unhappy because I'm "not enough"
      - There's always something better I can do, and that alone will never satiate the feeling of being "enough". That's just being human though.
      - What's more important is to keep being the person that I am because, at least so far, it's been what has taken me to where I am now, and is what keeps me feeling like I'm headed in a generally 'good' direction.
        - The person that I am is caring, funny, curious, inventive, and vulnerable.
          - Foregoing the person that I am now and have been, would be a great tragedy.
