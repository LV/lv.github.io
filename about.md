Hey! My name is Luis Victoria. I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico and have lived all over the world; from the US, to Brazil, to Mexico, to Singapore, and now Canada.

I am currently studying Business and Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. I am aspiring to fulfill my life-long dream of becoming an entrepreneur, working on my own endeavors and building all sorts of applications for the betterment of society. During my time at university, my main goal is to have completed a large-scale application with a team of people who share the same vision, passion, dreams, and goals as I do.

I am using this site firstly as a blog to share some of the progress I have made with some of my projects and secondly as an online portfolio, where I'll share the finished products of some of my projects. I'm glad you've stumbled onto this site and I hope you'll enjoy some of the stuff on here. Cheers!

P.S. I'm keeping the source code to this site open source, so feel free to [check it out!](https://github.com/LV/lv.github.io)
