Welcome to **lambda.lv**! As of now, the page will be my personal blog and ramblings about a bunch of different things. I always procrastinate posting so this will be my first every post. I will start off by randomly writing things and sharing them because I've been seeking perfection for too long only to never actually publish anything.

Perhaps in the future, I'll have better quality control. Regardless, you will be able to find the history of this entire webpage on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lv/lv.github.io).

Welcome to the site! :)
