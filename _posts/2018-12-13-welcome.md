Welcome to my personal website! Here it is, the online portfolio I've been meaning to create for a while. Funnily enough, I started this repo about two years ago but I'm revisting it now. For the most part, this site will just be showcasing the projects that I will create over time and hopefully I'll have some nice things in there! I'm keeping this site open source and you can find the [GitHub Repo here](https://github.com/LV/lv.github.io).

I'm really hoping this project is the start of many more things to come, I've recently rediscovered my passion for programming (hence why I'm re-dusting this site after two years) and now is when things will begin.

Happy 2019!
