# lv.github.io

lv.github.io is my personal web portfolio, where I will showcase:

- My Online Profiles from sites such as StackOverflow or my progress in programs such as FreeCodeCamp
- Past/Current Projects (some of them will be interactive)

In addition I will also use this as a personal blog where I will discuss what I am doing with a certain project.

The main purpose of this site however is to also be able to experiment a bit with new things I have learnt, which is why there will be some overkill features that are unnecessary to the site such as having Travis-CI or even some SSL certificate in the future.

Despite the site running on GitHub Pages and the name of the repository being lv.github.io (original host location), the URL will be http://luisvictoria.me

### My Profiles

On that note, I might as well just promote some of my online web presence because why not?
